NOT READY FOR USE YET. NEEDS TO BE REDONE


This tutorial will show you how to build your own topology,
run and configure nfd, run ndnpingserver on a server node
and then successfully ndnping from a client node.

1. Start the RLI.

2. Add an NPR to use as an IP router.
   Topology Menu
     Select Add IXPCluster
       Select Add NPRCluster
         How many instances? 
           leave as 1 and click OK.
   Two NPRs should show up in your RLI panel.
   Move NPR.2 off to the side. We will not be using it.
   Move NPR.1 to the middle. This will be our IP router.

3. Add two hosts.
   Topology Menu
     Select Add pc2core
       Select Add Host2core
         How many instances? 
           change to 2 and click OK.
   Two Host2cores will appear in the upper left corner of the RLI panel.
     (They will actually be one on top of the other so you may only see one)
   Move one of the Host2cores close to (1 inch away) from port 2 of NPR.1.
   Move the other Host2core close to (1 inch away) from port 4 of NPR.1.

4. Connect your topology.
   At the top of your RLI, in the menu bar you should see a button
   that says "Links Off". This tells you that the ability to draw 
   links is currently turned Off.
   Click the "Links Off" button to turn link drawing on.
   The button should now say "Links On".
   Take your mouse and click on port 4 of the NPR and without releasing the
   mouse drag it to the Host2core you placed near port 4. This should draw
   a dashed line. When you release your mouse over the Host2core, its name
   should change, probably to h1x2.
   Now do a similar thing with port 2 and the Host2core you placed
   near port 2. This should change the name of this Host2core, probably
   to h2x2.
   Turn off the link drawing ability by clicking the "Links On" button.

5. Define default routes.
   Topology menu
     Select Generate Default Routes.
       "Previously generated routes will be removed first."
         Click OK.

6. Save your topology
   File menu
     Select Save As ...
       Give it a name in the "Save As:" entry
         perhaps something like MyTwoHostTopo
         Click Save

   Now you have a saved version of this topology that you can reload later.

7. Make a reservation for (hopefully) right now.
   File menu
     Make Reservation
       In the Duration of experiment, hours: enter 1
       Click Enter.
       You should get a popup window asking for your User Name and Password.
       Enter your ONL User Name and Password and click Enter.
   Wait for popup confirming the reservation.
   Check the Date and Time in the confirmation. If it is for now
   then we are ready to go on to the next step. Click OK.

8. Commit the experiment
   File menu
     select Commit.
   Wait until the indicator at the bottom of the RLI shows "Commit Completed".
   Now you have a commit experiment and you can log in to your hosts.

From here on we assume that the two hosts are named h1x2 and h2x2.
If they are not, then substitute the names you have.

9. Set up your ~/.ndn directory (This should only have to be done once on onlusr)
   > mkdir -p ~/.ndn
   > cat > ~/.ndn/client.conf << EOF
transport=unix:///tmp/nfd.sock
protocol=nrd-0.1
EOF

10. Log in to host h1x2.
   Open a terminal window and ssh in to onl.wustl.edu
   Once you are logged in to onl
     > source ~/.topology
     > ssh $h1x2


11. Test IP connectivity
    From your terminal window which is logged in to h1x2:
    > ping -c 5 h2x2
    PING h2x2 (192.168.2.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from h2x2 (192.168.2.2): icmp_req=1 ttl=63 time=164 ms
    64 bytes from h2x2 (192.168.2.2): icmp_req=2 ttl=63 time=0.152 ms
    64 bytes from h2x2 (192.168.2.2): icmp_req=3 ttl=63 time=0.151 ms
    64 bytes from h2x2 (192.168.2.2): icmp_req=4 ttl=63 time=0.150 ms
    64 bytes from h2x2 (192.168.2.2): icmp_req=5 ttl=63 time=0.151 ms

    --- h2x2 ping statistics ---
    5 packets transmitted, 5 received, 0% packet loss, time 3997ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.150/33.064/164.720/65.828 ms

12. Log in to host h2x2
   Open a terminal window and ssh in to onl.wustl.edu
   Once you are logged in to onl
     > source ~/.topology
     > ssh $h2x2

13. Configure h2x2 as your server
    In the terminal window logged in to h2x2:
    Start nfd:
         h2x2> nfd >& nfd.server.log &
    Configure an NDN route to your client:
         h2x2> nfdc register /ndn/client udp4://h1x2:6363
    Start ndnpingserver
         h2x2> ndnpingserver ndn:/ndn/server

14. Configure h1x2 as your client
    In the terminal window logged in to h1x2:
    Start nfd:
         h1x2> nfd >& nfd.client.log &
    Configure an NDN route to your server:
         h1x2> nfdc register /ndn/server udp4://h2x2:6363
    Run ndnping
         h1x2> ndnping -c 5 ndn:/ndn/server
         PING /ndn/server
         content from /ndn/server: seq=14581705676331575985 time=5.49469 ms
         content from /ndn/server: seq=14581705676331575986 time=0.87564 ms
